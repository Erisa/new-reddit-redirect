# New Reddit Redirect

Love Reddit's redesign? New Reddit Redirect will ensure that you always load the standard (www.reddit.com) design when linked to old or new subdomains.

**DO NOT** install alongside "Old Reddit Redirect" or you will be unable to access Reddit until one extension is removed.

Will force all reddit.com usage to www.reddit.com. Will work when navigating to the site, opening links, using old bookmarks. Works regardless of whether you are logged in or not, and in incognito mode.

Contrary to the name, will not force you to new regardless of user settings. This extension essentially disables the forced design subdomains (`old.reddit.com` and `new.reddit.com` and replaces them with your preferred). Since most people who love to use the old design are already forcing their reddit links to `old.reddit.com`, this helps you to click them and end up where you normally would if not forced.  
The name is a play on the original code's name and because the author of this modification created it with the intent of redirecting old links to use their default style, which is set to new.
